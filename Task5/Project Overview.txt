Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a 2-bit comparator using the VSDSquadron Mini board. A 2-bit comparator is a digital circuit that compares two 2-bit binary numbers and indicates whether one number is greater than, less than, or equal to the other. The project involves designing the comparator logic using C programming in Visual Studio Code, setting up the hardware connections on a breadboard, and verifying the functionality through LEDs connected to the output.

Project Objective
The objective of this project is to:
1. Design a 2-bit comparator using C programming.
2. Implement the designed comparator on the VSDSquadron Mini board.
3. Verify the correct functionality of the comparator by using LEDs to display the comparison results.
4. Gain hands-on experience in digital circuit design, C programming, and hardware implementation.

Key Components
1. VSDSquadron Mini Board : The main microcontroller board used for processing and logic implementation.
2. Breadboard and Jumper Wires : For building and testing the circuit.
3. LEDs : To display the comparison results.This project requires 3 LEDs.
4. Resistors : To limit the current to the LEDs.220Ohm resistors are used in this project.

Pin Configuration
LED	VSD SQUADRON BOARD
LED1	PIN4 (PD4)
LED2	PIN5 (PD5)
LED3	PIN6 (PD6)

Functional Description
A > B: LED1 (Yellow color) lights up when a is greater than b.
A < B: LED2 (Red color) lights up when a is less than b.
A = B: LED3 (Green color) lights up when both numbers are equal.
