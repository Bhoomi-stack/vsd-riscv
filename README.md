VSDSquadron Research Internship 2024


Our program leverages the RISC-V architecture and harnesses open-source tools to educate participants about VLSI chip design and RISC-V fundamentals. Led by the esteemed Instructor Kunal Ghosh Sir, this initiative offers hands-on experience and expert guidance

#Basic Details:

Name: Bhoomika V

College: ATME College of Engineering

Github Profile: BHoomi_Stack


#Task1:


Task1 is to install all the essential tools required for this internship such as Ubuntu on VirtualBox, GNU Toolchain, GTKWave, Yosys and iVerilog simulator.


#Task2:


Task3 is to refer to C based and RISCV based lab videos and execute the task of compiling the C code using gcc and riscv compiler.


#Task 3:


This Task is to identify instruction type of all the given instructions with its exact 32 bits instruction code in the desired instruction type format.


#Task 4: 

Performing SPIKE Simulation and Debugging the C code with Interactive Debugging Mode using Spike and By making use of RISCV Core: Verilog Netlist and Testbench, perform an experiment of Functional Simulation and observe the waveforms.


#Task 5: 


This Task is about the Project name and the complete details.


#Task 6: 


Final Task of this internship is to implement any digital circuits using VSDSquadron Mini and check whether the building and uploading of C program file on RISCV processor works.


Conclusion


This implementation demonstrates the use of the VSDSquadron Mini board to design a basic digital circuit. The 2-bit comparator effectively compares two binary numbers and outputs the comparison results through LEDs. This project reinforces the fundamental concepts of digital design.Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience.
